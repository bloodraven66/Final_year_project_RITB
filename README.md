extension of our final year project - " Signal processing approaches for noise reduction in pulsed thermography"
### Objectives:
- Improve SNR in thermal images:<br>
  Explore the use of autoencoders to obtain this. <br>
- Obtain better defect detection/visibility:<br>
  Using LSTM to visualize defects and identify depth one-shot in a test dataset.
